She slipped into her slippers, stuffed her mouth with her mouthwash foam, took a quick shower and messed up her entire room in the process of choosing that one obvious dress which she would wear on any random day when she had a date.>/p>\r\n\r\nHaving earphones plugged, listening to Fedde le Grand from Tomorrowland she walked towards the parkingâ€¦ when a rally of a group of youngsters just like her caught her attention. Since there were lots of social and global issues of concern buzzing around, creating havocs, she presumed it to be an outcome of the same. Having no interest in probing into the matter she decided to just drive off.\r\n\r\nThe mob of youngsters apparently seemed to fight for a genuine cause using the lower standards of social graces, calling out loud and provocative slogans like a hooligan tribe. Her over excitement about the date had actually overpowered her moral conscience that forbid her from making herself aware of the happenings around her.\r\n\r\nShe waited for the crowd to clear off before heading towards west gate. Once she reached there she rang up Varun and wondered what took him so late to reachâ€¦ all of a sudden Varun came running towards her panting , and in huge exasperation he told her â€œ câ€™mon we need to go and fight for our rightsâ€¦ quick lets join the rally.â€\r\n\r\nShe had no idea what he was talking about and no hint about what she was running toâ€¦.kk\r\n\r\nShe saw people carrying placards saying, give us our choice, give us the freedom to live our life the way we want, , make HETROSEXUALITY legal !!!\r\n\r\nShia screamedâ€¦. â€œWhat the hell is this?â€ He said â€œhoney why are you being so unfamiliar with the things that we have been going through? The social stigmas, fear of what the society would subject us to, scared to be ambushed if the reality ever came out, itâ€™s all going to end... come!!â€ Shia, beyond any realms of doubt was baffled and scared to death. â€œDid I just wake up from a good dream or am I having a nightmare? â€œ this was the only thought her mind was occupied with all the time while she was moving like a zombie in the ILLEGAL crowd of THE HETROSEXUALS.\r\n\r\nFriends, imagineâ€¦ one fine day this so called mainstream crowd of heterosexuals becoming the minority and being overpowered by the majority of bisexuals and homosexuals. Will they at that point of time prefer to be stakeholders in the excruciating torments, atrocities, brickbats and all those extremely preposterous allegations which used to be inflicted on their counterparts?\r\n\r\nCan these mainstream heterosexuals imagine living their lives as homosexuals under the sheer pressure of the homosexual society they would be living in (fictionally)? Try imagining living like someone who is not you.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what our counterparts (the homosexuals) are going through.\r\n\r\nA minute of thought is worth sparing for this very bleeding concern over which our society is fostering its culture, its stigmas, its believes and its ideals.\r\n\r\nBeing the mainstream and blaming the minority for their exceptional attributes or for being different is a very easy task, but being the minority and showing the courage to fight for your desire, to ask shamelessly for your freedom, to beg for the choice to live your life the way you want is the exemplary audacity that this world is showcasing.\r\n\r\nThough the size of the dog in this fight is small, but definitely the size of the fight in the dog is huge.\r\n\r\nOn july20, 2013, first Indian wedding of lesbian couples Shanon and Seema took place in The US.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly an extraordinary step towards a more revolutionized world; helping bridge the difference between both the worlds gradually.\r\n\r\nI would just like to say that itâ€™s not important for each one of us to understand their world, their feelings or that particular attribute that sets them apart from usâ€¦ neither am I asking you to respect homosexuality .\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I want you to respect is the very reason of life and the choice that every individual makes to live their life the way they want.\r\n\r\nCongratulations Sahnon and Seemaâ€¦ you guys nailed itâ€¦\r\n\r\nI bet a day will surely come when the fight is wonâ€¦.

Sonali Mukherjee, a girl who was brutally burnt, a being that does not have tear glands to let some tears out while in pain, a friend people set out their ridiculed looks at despite being beautiful, a sister with an extremely distorted face, a daughter who had nothing but pain and only pain during her good age, an epitome of courage charred into a vegetative existence, Sonali, a hapless human who was a victim of one of the most ruthless forms of social discrepancies: ACID ATTACK.\r\n\r\nShe is not the only one who has suffered this, there are many like her who paid the price for standing against the patriarchal society and the social stigmas that do nothing but suffocate and kill the human race.\r\n\r\nAfter reading about her, the only thing I had in my mind was to write about acid attack, the excruciating pain such victims underwent the mental and physical trauma they are subjected to and the social discrimination that comes on their way.\r\n\r\nI was all set to write with my laptop in front of me, and at that great moment of cognizance with my conscience I realized that I could not express what I wanted toâ€¦ taking aid of mere words, for a moment I wished if my written words had some automatic sensors that would let whosoever reading it feel a tinge of the same pain she was once succumbed to, a tinge of the same horror she experienced and a deeper insight into the life of insufficiency, depression, unfathomable grief, and all those very emotions loathed by the human race she went through during such a short span of time.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of April 2003, world apparently came to an end for Sonali when three men from her locality gave a green signal to their motive behind the clandestine meetings they held for about one and a half month after their encounter with the GHAMNDI girl.\r\n\r\nShe was punished for being who she was, she was punished because she spurned the sexual advances of few man eating monsters who rewarded her with tremendous pain, social and self rejection, a life of exile and a life that brought about pain and its allies but never its counterparts.\r\n\r\nHer face was ridiculously disfigured, the skin on her face was melted and diffused, credits to the most ubiquitous disinfectant ACID, it then later coagulated into a black and red mass of rug I must say, that gave her pain and would continue giving her lot more and nothing else. I canâ€™t describe her appearance and I definitely know, itâ€™s not because of lack of knowledge of the language or the lack of an enriched vocabulary but itâ€™s just because of the lack of expressions, no word of assertion can define or illustrate her physical condition and the obsolete life she had and still has.\r\n\r\nSonaliâ€™s father a menial mill worker had to sell of his land, his house and his wifeâ€™s long preserved jewels for her treatment.\r\n\r\nToday he is left with nothing, other than a destructed and doomed life, a burnt dream, his daughter and lot of debts and humiliation. Neither the law makers nor the sympathizers could give her what she wanted, I am sure she would have wanted much more that seeing her accused behind the bars, she would have wanted them immersed in the same venom that destructed her life.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sonali knocked the doors of many hospitals, underwent almost 22 surgeries but has failed to be like what she was almost ten years back.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to her story itâ€™s just next to impossible to believe that Sonali used to be beautiful 18 years old, pursuing sociology honours from Dhanbad womenâ€™s college, a part of the National Cadet Corps and most importantly a courageous and brave girl who was all set to step into the bounties of womanhood, before acid ruined her life while she slept unaware of the math that was awaiting her.\r\n\r\nYes she did visit many legislators, MPs, and the then CM of Jharkand too and of course she did receive lot many heartfelt condolences and assurance but she needed much more.\r\n\r\nFor almost ten years she suffered silently in pain, begged for better justice, and cried tears of fumes that no one could see or wipe away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<\r\n\r\nIn the year 2012, Sonali featured along with Lara Dutta in Indiaâ€™s biggest quiz show â€˜Kaun Banega Crore Patiâ€™, and won Rs. 25,00000.\r\n\r\nYes undoubtedly this lime light gave her a new ray of hope, paved way for a new life that was once stagnant, and enabled her to create that level of awareness she had aspired for.\r\n\r\nI believe God gave this blessing in response to the excruciating pain she underwent and the only plea she made before the law, â€œI want justice, or allow me to end my life.â€\r\n\r\nI retold the tale told once again, intervening it with my very emotions, but I still havenâ€™t told what I want, what I expect and what ought to be done.\r\n\r\nAre we not supposed to say a word due to the fear of being victims of acid attack, or are we supposed to simply let those scoundrels stare at our cleavage and never dare to hurt their good for nothing pride, just because of the fear of being attacked with acid the next day.\r\n\r\nAre we supposed to let them violate the sanctity of womanhood by letting them touch wherever they please to, and letting them click zoomed in photographs of whatever part they want to.\r\n\r\nI want to yell out and beg, to the great men of our country to please do something before a mere 50 rupees bottle of acid ruins the priceless life of someone else like Sonali, before it burns the life of someone who did not fear and stood against the wrong, donâ€™t let anyone pay such a huge price for being what they are and for standing against the odds of the society.\r\n\r\nAll what I donâ€™t want is yet another Sonali to be born.\r\n\r\nI donâ€™t want yet another human begging for death, as a reward of showing a bit of valour against the odds of life.','2015-07-17 06:54:13','2015-07-22 13:30:33',NULL,NULL),(21,'Meaning Of

Just for the sake of curiosity I continuously kept clicking the â€˜nextâ€™ button and apparently stopped after opening almost fifteen pages considering it to be a very dumb act and a sheer wastage of the scanty one GB internet that was left in my account. I went back to the first page and opened a youtube video of â€˜The Oprah Showâ€™, which obviously addressed this very issue of global and national concern: Child Abuse.\r\n\r\nThere were many participants in the episode as the regular Oprah style, but interestingly one participant out of those many exceptionally caught my attention. â€˜Trudy Chaseâ€™ an ordinary woman with an extraordinary schizophrenia: A woman who lived with ninety two different personalities in Herself: Result of the excruciating sexual abuse by her step father which started off at the tender age of twoâ€¦. Indeed a paradigm of how far childâ€™s mental growth and thought process can be adversely affected by the atrocities inflicted upon them during their childhood.\r\n\r\nThe status quo of India is no different, according to a very sophisticated report published by the UNICEF more 50% children (both male and female) are victims of sexual abuse, which either leaves them mentally challenged or physically crippled for their entire life. I have personally witnessed few doctors and medical staffs giving testimonials about how hard it is for them to see and treat children who have undergone extreme levels of sexual abuse, itâ€™s painful to see their physical injuries and torn bodies getting stitched up as well the mental trauma they have undergone tightening its grip on the well being of their sub conscience.\r\n\r\nFriends, I just want to raise a rhetoric question that Shobha De had raised in one of her journals â€œyou can stitch her torn vagina, but who will stitch her torn life?â€\r\n\r\nI remember, being a little girl how I used to feel reluctant about being touched or being cuddled by males, who had a big stature, rough-torn look, shabby hair and lot many attributes that are generally associated with the so called BAD GUYS, may be at that point of time appearance was the sole parameter I used, to judge the good and evil within men.\r\n\r\nIn the later phases of life the list of my parameters kept on increasing. Misguided by utterly sweet people at times, suffocated by overly caring and pretentious love offered, I grew up realizing many of the tantrums that people throw and many of those tricks they bothered to play, yetâ€¦ unaware of the many heart wrenching raw realities that many lives were going through.\r\n\r\nI came out of my room and went straight into my friendâ€™s room. I was welcomed with a sarcastic comment â€œAaj kya masaala lekar aayii haiâ€ to which I plafully replied â€œbagal ke momos waale ka masaala lekar aayi hun.â€\r\n\r\nSoon we were joined by few more friends and started talking vague girlish talksâ€¦ according to the first rule of hostel we are not supposed to discuss any latest news, anything which is of national importance or anything that would be related to the palm or the lotus, neither about the status of rupees nor about the current account deficit.\r\n\r\nAll that we are allowed to discuss is about the latest chick flicks, link ups, hook ups, break ups, pre and post break up stress, and all those matters that apparently do no good and no harm to the society.\r\n\r\nWe were discussing about Richaâ€™s new crush, when at an instant I showed the courage to bring up a thought that was in mind since the time I saw the video of Trudy Chase. Surprisingly all were interested about sharing their views and experiencesâ€¦ ya when I say experiences, yes I do mean that we all had our share of experiences to share. One by one we all started to pour out whatever we had kept hidden since years.\r\n\r\nâ€œHe was my auto driver who used to drop me to school; he used to hold me real tight with his arms wrapped tightly round my chest. It used to pain but I never told this to anyone back home.â€ Said kanchan\r\n\r\nâ€œHe was my guitar teacher, he used to make lewd comments and one day he tried to kiss me showing that damn fake paternal love, which he generally made use of, to fool out every girl in the classâ€¦ Only I know how hard I had to try to escape from his dirty claws.â€ I added.\r\n\r\nâ€œI used to call him chacha guysâ€¦ imagine!! One day I went to his shop to ask for some new movie DVDs and he forcefully made me sit on his lap, and was trying to adjust me on his lap in a very weird wayâ€¦ and now I understand what that moron was actually trying to do\" said Aadi.\r\n\r\nâ€œyou know what I had gone with my mom dad to watch a movie, and was coming out of the theatre when I noticed a middle aged man very, shabby with that dirty paan stained lips giving me lunatic looks and passing a wicked smile.

The girls as usual were back to their actual senses and started discussing about Richaâ€™s latest crush.\r\n\r\nLate that night, Pari came to my room her eyes were little swollen and she told me â€œyaar I seriously hate discussing about these stuffs, you donâ€™t know what I have been through.â€\r\n\r\nI wondered for a moment if she had fallen in love with Richaâ€™s latest crush but then I realized that the matter was pretty graver.\r\n\r\nShe told me about that terrible incident of her childhood which had almost ruined her life, I guess I donâ€™t need to explain what had happened as you yourself can make out the matter.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact I myself did not receive much explanation but could make out the fact, yes she was sexually exploited very badly in her childhood: By one of her paternal uncles.\r\n\r\nAll I could tell her was not to cry but pry on such people, bring them out in the lime light and rip apart their mask of pseudo goodness.\r\n\r\nFriends I know that I donâ€™t live in a utopian society, but I also fail to understand why the so called law makers and justice auctioneers are perpetuating this social evil rather than trying to eliminate it.\r\n\r\nWhat do they expect a baby thatâ€™s just three months old to do, in order safeguard its little chastity?\r\n\r\nWhat bulwark against this beastlike world are those little hapless creatures supposed to have?\r\n\r\nDo they expect every mother to whisper into their new bornâ€™s ear â€œMY CHILD YOU ARE NOT SAFE BEWARE OF THE BEASTSâ€ as soon as the umbilical cord is cut.\r\n\r\nI believe that our country requires an ethnic cleansing that would remove all social evils, injustices and as a mater beyond any doubts, all those who practice it.\r\n\r\nI know that I am extremely cynical about the issue, and I donâ€™t expect our law makers or law keepers to go out personally to every place where children are being sexually abused and mentally harassed, but I do expect them to formulate real stringent laws and strict punishments that can extend up to death sentence for such inhumane deeds.\r\n\r\nApart from this, agreeing with Shobha De again, I would wish to personally deliver a kick between the legs of those man-eating monsters who donâ€™t even feel like sparing a new born.\r\n\r\nYOU DAMN SONS OF A BITCHâ€¦ the lingering stench of your putrefied souls is a mess over here; spare us your kinky thoughts and kinky desires.\r\n\r\nYet I have no answer to this very question that my soul raises against me all the time â€œhow long will you keep on protecting herâ€¦ if you ever happen to have a baby girl?

Cricket club owners becoming cricket administrators, and some of them betting on the basis of insider information. What next? More scams are certain to emerge, regardless of which party rules Delhi and state capitals. The problem is systemic. India has become a republic of greed.\r\n\r\nWe need to distinguish between two kinds of greed. One can simply be called corporate greed. Gordon Gekko, the flawed hero of Oliver Stoneâ€™s film, Wall Street, provided its most flamboyant exposition: â€œGreed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures, the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all its forms â€¦ has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed, you mark my words, willâ€¦ save that â€¦ malfunctioning corporation called the USA.â€\r\n\r\nWhether or not greed can save the USA or India, most mature market economies know how to deal with its excessive forms. They develop a regulatory structure, which concedes that profit-seeking is the foundation of market economics, but it also adds that the avaricious incarnations of greed will be punished.\r\n\r\nInsider trading is a crime. Stealing proprietary knowledge is a crime. Providing confidential information to business collaborators after a board meeting is a crime. For committing such crimes, famed business executives have gone to jail in the US.\r\n\r\nBut the greed that marks the recent storm of scams in India is not an instance of corporate greed. It is something more comprehensive. It is about a business-politics nexus that corrupts business as well as politics.\r\n\r\nIt is about businessmen purchasing political elites and the political elites walking into wealth that their own entrepreneurship did not create. It is their power to grant permissions and licences that has generated wealth, not their innovative business ideas.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the rot is deeper. If you ask why Indiaâ€™s leading cricket stars have not spoken out against what the judicial investigation has called contemptible corruption in their sport, you can see that the net of beneficiaries is wider. It not only includes politicians and businessmen, but also sports stars, some of whom were admired for their honesty, not only their extraordinary skill.\r\n\r\nHas India plunged into an ethical abyss? To be sure, that is the case for many, though not all. We do have administrators and police officers fighting rapacious politicians. Some businessmen are turning to philanthropy, and quite a few politicians continue to be incorruptible. But these valiant souls do not define the core of the system. The core is to be characterised differently.\r\n\r\nAs Jayant Sinha, currently a minister of state in the Modi government, and i have written elsewhere, India is going through a â€œgilded ageâ€, a term coined by Mark Twain in 1873 to describe the conditions of the US, his native land. What were those conditions?\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the US, a primarily rural society until then, started rapidly urbanising as economic growth took off. In cities, political machines were born, linking voters to politicians in clientelistic exchanges. Income opportunities vastly expanded, the emerging wealth was heavily concentrated, and the poor were shabbily treated. Ethnic and racial prejudice was on the rise.\r\n\r\nFinally, corruption marked all levels of government. Those who controlled New Yorkâ€™s city government used their insider knowledge of public projects to buy land. Railroad barons bought state legislators to install their railway tracks.\r\n\r\nAt the topmost levels in Washington â€“ for example, in the administration of President Ulysses Grant â€“ Cabinet level appointees were indicted for malfeasance. Corruption, argues James Morone, a leading scholar of that period, was at the heart of American politics in the second half of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nNor was the US a unique example of this tendency. Transformation of a rural South Korea and Taiwan into industrialised economies in the 1970s and 1980s was accompanied by some of the same features. Though not democratic, China, too, has gone through its gilded age.\r\n\r\nBut all these societies had to develop mechanisms to rein in corruption. All realised that while a poor society desperately needs rapid economic growth, corruption has to be controlled. If everything can be bought, one canâ€™t separate the able from the crooked: no self-respecting society can function like that.\r\n\r\nIn the US, Theodore Roosevelt inaugurated the so-called progressive era, aimed at cleaning up the business-politics nexus, a project that intermittently returns to US politics. In the 1990s and later, corporate executives and politicians in South Korea went to jail. Chinaâ€™s current anti-corruption drive is stringent.\r\n\r\nWhen will India begin its cleansing? Modi had promised to attack corruption in his election campaign. His silence on the conduct of his own party colleagues has to be viewed as hugely paradoxical.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the matter is well understood. For all practical purposes, Indiaâ€™s business funds the nationâ€™s elections. Until campaign finance issues are squarely tackled, the collusive links between business and politics canâ€™t easily be broken.\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly more to Indiaâ€™s corruption than how elections and parties are financed, but political finance remains at its core. BJP is ideologically distinct from Congress, but on how parties are financed, is it any different?\r\n','2015-07-17 09:20:46','2015-07-20 07:31:40',NULL,NULL),(25,'My life, my ways','I have always been fond of books, writers, stories. and much more which i expected to fall into my way on their own but they never did.It was obviously strange then\r\nbut for now m happy.\r\nHave started writng a diary now, i love to write','2015-07-17 09:59:58','2015-07-20 12:17:06',NULL,NULL),(27,'user_article_1','2.3 Path and URL Helpers\r\n\r\nCreating a resourceful route will also expose a number of helpers to the controllers in your application.
