							 A good blog exists independently of people reading it.
							<br>Even if no one read my blog, I'd still write it. Not exactly sure why.Maybe it's something like this -- I would still cook even if I was the only person eating.
							<br>Some people seem to feel the need to justify blogging, blogging is still alive they say, but it's actually more than alive blogging is a cultural fixture. "Thriving".
